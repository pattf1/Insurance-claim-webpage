Project Overview
Purpose
The Customer Self-Service Portal is designed for the insurance industry, enabling customers to manage their insurance claims efficiently. It provides an intuitive interface for submitting claims, tracking their status, accessing assistance through a chatbot, and searching a knowledge base.

Key Features
Claim Submission:

Customers can fill out a form to submit new insurance claims, including necessary details such as policy number, incident description, and date of occurrence.
File upload functionality allows users to attach supporting documents.
Upon submission, users receive immediate feedback with a success message.
Claim Tracking:

A dedicated section displays a list of submitted claims, including details like claim number, submission date, and current status.
Users can easily track their claims in real-time.
Chatbot Assistance:

An integrated chatbot powered by Dialogflow provides users with answers to common questions about the claims process.
The chatbot can direct users to relevant resources or escalate queries to live customer service if needed.
Knowledge Base:

A search feature enables users to find articles and FAQs related to insurance processes and claims.
Results are displayed dynamically based on user queries.
